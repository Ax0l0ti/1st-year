### Detailed Explanation

#### Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes the relationship. It is widely used for predictive modeling, where the model's parameters are estimated using methods such as least squares.

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification that models the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables. It uses the logistic function to map predicted values to probabilities, facilitating classification tasks. Logistic regression is applied in fields such as medicine, finance, and social sciences.

#### Decision Trees
Decision trees are a type of model used for both classification and regression tasks, splitting data into branches to represent decision paths. Each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or continuous value. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data.

#### Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. They work by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are versatile in terms of the kernel functions that can be specified for the decision function. They are widely used in applications such as image classification, bioinformatics, and text categorization.
