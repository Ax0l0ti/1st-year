### Detailed Explanation

#### Conditional Independence
Conditional independence in Bayesian networks refers to a situation where two variables are independent given the knowledge of a third variable. This property simplifies the representation and computation of the joint probability distribution of the network. Conditional independence is used to construct and reason with Bayesian networks efficiently.

#### D-Separation
D-Separation is a criterion used to decide whether a set of variables is independent of another set, given a third set, within a Bayesian network. It provides a graphical method to test for conditional independence without explicitly calculating probabilities. Understanding D-Separation is crucial for interpreting and manipulating Bayesian networks.

#### Inference in Bayesian Networks
Inference in Bayesian networks involves computing the posterior distribution of a subset of variables given observed values of other variables. Techniques such as exact inference (e.g., variable elimination) and approximate inference (e.g., Monte Carlo methods) are used to perform this task. Inference enables prediction, diagnosis, and decision making in uncertain environments.

#### Applications of Bayesian Networks
Applications of Bayesian networks include diagnosis, prediction, anomaly detection, decision support systems, and bioinformatics. They are used in various domains such as medicine, engineering, and finance to model complex probabilistic relationships and make informed decisions based on incomplete or uncertain data.
