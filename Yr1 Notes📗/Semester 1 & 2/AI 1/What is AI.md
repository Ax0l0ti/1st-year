AI is about constrained knowledge representations that support the making of models to facilitate an understanding of thinking, perception, and action.

Characteristics that define an AI can be categorised into: 
	- Thinking Humanly (HT)
	- Behaving humanly (HB)
	- Thinking rationally / ideally (IT)
	- Behaving rationally / ideally (IB)

### Agents

An **agent** is something that **acts** 
A **Rational Agent** is something that **acts rationally**

> [!bug] We are agents technically...
