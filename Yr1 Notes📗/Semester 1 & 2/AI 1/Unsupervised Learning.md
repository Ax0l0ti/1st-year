### Speed Run

1. Break down of topic
	$a)$ Clustering - Clustering involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
	$b)$ Dimensionality Reduction - Dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of random variables under consideration, simplifying models without losing significant information.
	$c)$ Principal Component Analysis - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and capture strong patterns in a dataset, reducing the dimensionality of the data.
	$d)$ Association Rules - Association rules are used in unsupervised learning to identify relationships between variables in large datasets, commonly used in market basket analysis.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Clustering
Clustering involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

#### Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of random variables under consideration, simplifying models without losing significant information.

#### Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and capture strong patterns in a dataset, reducing the dimensionality of the data.

#### Association Rules
Association rules are used in unsupervised learning to identify relationships between variables in large datasets, commonly used in market basket analysis.
