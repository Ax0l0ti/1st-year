### Speed Run

1. Break down of topic
	$a)$ Prime Numbers - Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
	$b)$ Greatest Common Divisor - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without a remainder.
	$c)$ Modular Arithmetic - Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain value, the modulus.
	$d)$ Fermat’s Little Theorem - Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a such that $1 ≤ a < p$, the number $(a^{p-1}) − 1$ is an integer multiple of p.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Prime Numbers
Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

#### Greatest Common Divisor
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without a remainder.

#### Modular Arithmetic
Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain value, the modulus.

#### Fermat’s Little Theorem
Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer $a$ such that $1 ≤ a < p$, the number $(a^{p-1}) − 1$ is an integer multiple of p.
