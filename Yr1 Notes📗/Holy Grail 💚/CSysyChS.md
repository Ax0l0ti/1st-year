#### Latches & Flip-Flops
[[Sequential Logic]]
**FLIPFLOP** takes **clock** as ==enabler==, **LATCH** **dis/enabled** at will this makes **flipflop** upd every ==clock cycle==
Everything is adaptions of $SR$ e.g $D$ is $SR$ but $R$ is $S'$, $JK$ is $SR$ 
##### Relationships and Usage

- **SR Latch**$\text{ Set Reset Latch}$:  Foundation of all other latches and flip-flops.
- **D Latch**$\text{ Data Latch}$: Simplifies SR latch by using a single data input.
- **D Flip-Flop** $\text{ Data FF}$ : Adds edge-triggered capability to D latch, used in ==synchronous== circuits.
- **JK Flip-Flop** $\text{ Jump Kick FF}$: ==Resolves SR== latch invalid state, adds versatility.
- **T Flip-Flop** $\text{ Toggle FF}$: Simplified JK flip-flop for ==toggling==, commonly used in counters.
