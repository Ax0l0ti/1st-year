| **Synopsis:**          | You will explore the variety of styles of programming languages, recognise and understand the differences between them, and choose an appropriate style for a given problem. You will learn to debug, profile, and benchmark your programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Content:**           | Programming paradigms and language families, for example Functional, Procedural, Object Oriented, Logic, Scripting, Declarative, Macro, Unstructured, Event Driven, etc. <br>Examples of languages from each style, with comparisons. <br>Further choices that languages provide, e.g., application based languages; interpreted, bytecoded and compiled; parallel and distributed; OO prototyping, delegation, traits, class centred; managed, unmanaged and garbage collected; static typed, dynamic typed and untyped; call by value, reference, name, need, etc. <br>Debugging, profiling and benchmarking techniques. |
