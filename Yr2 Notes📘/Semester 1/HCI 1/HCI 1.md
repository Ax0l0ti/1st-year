| **Learning Outcomes:** | After successfully completing this unit, students will be able to:<br><br>- Explain principles of interaction design that apply across a diverse range of interactive systems.<br>- Apply interaction and user experience design methods to produce a demonstrable prototype of an interactive system, which provides support for the goals of a defined user group.<br>- Use of IT (T/F, A), Problem Solving (T/F, A), Working with Others (T/F, A), Communication (A). |
| **Synopsis:**          | Working in a team, you will apply interaction design and user experience design methods to develop a demonstrable prototype of an interactive system. You will consider principles of user interfaces, user experience, and user testing, including its ethical implications.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Content:**           | General foundations of HCI. Design Methods (e.g. models of interaction, prototyping techniques, principles of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, designing for accessibility). Introduction to evaluation, including ethical considerations for user testing.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
