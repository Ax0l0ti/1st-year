| **Learning Outcomes:** | - Analyse relevant information to define a Comp Sci problem and to construct a software requirements specification that encapsulates it.<br>- Use models and test cases to create software that conforms to a specification.<br>- Adopt and adhere to a modern software process, supported by appropriate tools, to manage risk in the context of group-based production of a system and within a frame of software quality management.<br>- Systematically test functional and non-functional aspects of a software system based on an evolving software requirements specification.<br>- Demonstrate awareness and understanding of project risks, cyber-security and ethical issues as system wide considerations.<br><br>- Design, prototype and evaluate a system using empirical methods.<br>- Perform and report evaluations of designed software.<br>- Information analysis, Report writing, Presentation skills, Group working, Critical reflection, Identification of opportunities for personal development, Project management (T/F,A), Communication (T/F,A), IT (T/F,A) |
| **Synopsis:**          | You will work in a team to propose, design, develop, and evaluate a software system, using a modern software process such as agile. You will learn how to gather requirements, specify software, develop models in preparation for writing code, as well as test and evaluate software. You will consider risk management, cyber-security, and other ethical aspects, as well as report on the process and the resulting software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
