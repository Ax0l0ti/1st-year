## Types of Noise

| Types of noise | definition                                                                                                                                                                                      | Example                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Thermal        | Also called ”Additive Gaussian Noise”<br>Often due to random fluctuations of electrons when photo sensor is amplified.<br>Highly related to ISO level<br>Apply Gaussian Noise to simulate       | ![[Thermal Noise Ex.png]] |
| Shot           | Also called ”Poisson Noise”<br>highly related to photodiode of which the signal strength is proportional to the number of photons that hits the sensor.<br>The photons hits the sensor randomly | ![[Shot Noise Ex.png]]    |
| Replacement    | Also called ”Salt&Pepper Noise”<br> ’Dead pixels’- dark<br>‘Hot pixels’- over bright                                                                                                            | ![[S&P Noise Ex.png]]     |
| Speckle        | Subjective speckles <br>Objective speckles <br>Commonly happen in medical image, Radar, etc                                                                                                     |                           |
