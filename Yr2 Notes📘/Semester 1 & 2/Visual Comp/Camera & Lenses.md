### Digital Cameral Types

>[!info] CMOS vs CCD 
> CMOS cheaper and less energy but lower quality
> CCD higher quality and less noise but more pricy

>[!example]+ CMOS vs CCD Extended
> Below is a table of all the feature comparisons
>
> |**Feature**|**CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)**|**CCD (Charge-Coupled Device)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Structure**|Individual pixel transistors; each pixel has its own amplifier|Photodiodes; charges are transferred sequentially across the chip|
|**Power Consumption**|Lower power consumption; suitable for battery-operated devices|Higher power consumption; less ideal for portable devices|
|**Speed**|Faster readout speeds; supports high frame rates|Slower readout speeds; limited frame rates in video|
|**Image Quality**|More noise in low-light; improving with technology|Higher image quality; better color reproduction and less noise|
|**Dynamic Range**|Historically lower dynamic range; improving with advancements|Wider dynamic range; captures details in bright and dark areas|
|**Cost**|Generally cheaper to manufacture|Typically more expensive to produce|
|**Common Applications**|Smartphones, webcams, consumer cameras|Professional cameras, scientific imaging, astronomy|


### Physics of a camera lense

![[Lense physic.png]]

The distances can be worked out as followed
$$\frac{1}{f} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{v}$$ where u distance from object, v distance from focal point and f distance from centre of lense's perpendicular bisector
