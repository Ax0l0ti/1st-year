## Continuous
### Euclidean Distance

>[!info]+ Euclidean Distance
> In short it is direct distance between 2 points in $n$ dimensional space
> Mathematically this $d$ can be defined as below $$ d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{n}{(p_0i - p_1i)^2}}$$
### Manhattan Distance

>[!info]+ Manhattan Distance
> Manhatten Distance is the distance of units travelled in a grid
> Mathematically this $d$ can be defined as below $$ d = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{(p_0i - p_1i)}$$
### Cosine Similarity

>[!info]+ 
> Cosine Similarity is the angle between 2 points around the origin
> Mathematically this $d$ can be defined as below $$ d = \frac{p_0\cdot p_1 }{|p_0||p_1|}$$

## Categorical

### Hamming Distance

>[!info]+ Hamming Distance
> Hamming Distance is similarity between 2 point's categories and is calculated by how many differences between 2 points categories 
> Mathematically $HD(p_0,p_1)$ can be defined as below 
> $$\begin{align}  
 p_0 = [x \space axis, y \space axis] \\
 p_0 = [1,0,0,1,0,0] \text{ would be the first category of each axis (out of 3 cats)} \\
 p_1 = [0,1,0,0,0,1]
> HD(p_0,p_1) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{|p_0i - p_1i|}
> \end{align}$$ 
> In the example above the value would be 4 





### Jaccard Similarity

>[!info]+ 
> Simply shared categories divided by total number of categories
> Defined as $$ \frac{A\cap B}{A \cup B} $$
