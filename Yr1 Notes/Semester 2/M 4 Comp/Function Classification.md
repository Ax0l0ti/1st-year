### Speed Run

1. Break down of topic
	a) Injective Functions - Injective functions, or one-to-one functions, are functions where each element of the range is mapped from a unique element of the domain.
	b) Surjective Functions - Surjective functions, or onto functions, are functions where every element of the range is mapped from at least one element of the domain.
	c) Bijective Functions - Bijective functions are functions that are both injective and surjective, meaning every element of the domain maps to a unique element of the range and vice versa.
	d) Function Composition - Function composition is the process of applying one function to the results of another, creating a new function.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Injective Functions
Injective functions, or one-to-one functions, are functions where each element of the range is mapped from a unique element of the domain.

#### Surjective Functions
Surjective functions, or onto functions, are functions where every element of the range is mapped from at least one element of the domain.

#### Bijective Functions
Bijective functions are functions that are both injective and surjective, meaning every element of the domain maps to a unique element of the range and vice versa.

#### Function Composition
Function composition is the process of applying one function to the results of another, creating a new function.
