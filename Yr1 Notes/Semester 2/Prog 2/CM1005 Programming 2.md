| **Learning Outcomes:** | By the end of the unit, you will be able to: <br><br>- write programs in an object-oriented programming language<br>- design and construct basic data structures and algorithms<br>- understand the basics of, and write programs containing, advanced programming techniques<br>- plan, organise and implement programs to support reuse and maintainability of the software<br>- apply a modern paradigm of software development.<br> |
| **Synopsis:**          | Building on [[CM12003 Programming 1 \|Prog 1]], you will learn about OOP style. You will also learn about and implement advanced programming techniques. Working in a team, you will plan, organise, and implement programs using a modern software engineering paradigm. You will learn about data structures and algorithms and implement server-client interaction.                                                                  |
| **Content:**           | Example topics include: introduction to a large-scale OOP language such as **Java**, introduction to data structures and algorithms, event handling and error handling, basic **multi-threading** and networking, basic software engineering, incremental development and Agile.                                                                                                                                                        |
