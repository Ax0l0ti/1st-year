| **Learning Outcomes:** | - Use established techniques for understanding human activity and modelling human-computer interactions.<br>- Select and use appropriate analytical and empirical evaluation techniques in order to critically evaluate an interaction design.<br>- Use of IT (T/F, A), Problem Solving (T/F, A), Working with Others (T/F, A), Communication (A).                                                                        |
| **Synopsis:**          | Building on [[CM22011 Human-Computer Interaction 1 \|HCI 1]], you will explore the fundamental theories and principles of the design and use of interactive systems. You will learn to model HCI, and to evaluate interaction designs empirically and analytically.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Content:**           | Content will cover a range of topics in HCI and user experience. Examples of topics include: <br>Human perception, cognition and performance as it relates to the design and use of interactive systems <br>Empirical Methods (e.g. quantitative and qualitative methods, usability testing) <br>Contemporary topics in HCI research (e.g. virtual, augmented and mixed reality user interfaces, human-robot interaction) |
