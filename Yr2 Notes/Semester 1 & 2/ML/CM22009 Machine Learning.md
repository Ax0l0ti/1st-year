| **Learning Outcomes:** | 1. distinguish between different formulations of the ML machine learning challenge such as supervised and reinforcement learning<br>2. demonstrate understanding of a wide range of ML techniques, their strengths, and their limitations <br>3. write code in a relevant programming language (e.g. Python) and employ software libraries to solve problems in ML. |
| **Synopsis:**          | You will explore a wide range of fundamental techniques in machine learning, and learn about their strengths and limitations. You will write code and use software libraries to apply these techniques to solve problems in machine learning.                                                                                                                       |
| **Content:**           | central concepts and algorithms of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning such as support vector machines, deep neural networks, regularisation, ensemble methods, random forest, Markov Decision Processes, Q-learning, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.                                                                                    |
