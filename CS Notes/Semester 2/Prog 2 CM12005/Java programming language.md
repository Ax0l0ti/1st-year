### Inheritance
>Inheritance allows the definition of classes as extensions of other classes.

Using these classes we can instantiate objects of the music and video files we own and add them to our database. 

For now our Music files may look like this
```Java
public class MusicFile{ 
	private String title ; 
	private String artist ; 
	private String comment; 
	public MusicFile(String theTitle, String theArtist) { 
		title = theTitle; 
		artist = theArtist; comment = ""; } 
	
	public void setComment (String newComment) {...} 
	public String getComment() {...} 
	public void print() {...} 
}
```
And our video files may look as such:
``` Java
public class Video{ 
	private String title ; 
	private String director ; 
	private String comment; 
	
	public Video(String theTitle, String theDirector) { 
		title = theTitle; 
		director = theDirector; comment = ""; 
	} 
	
	public void setComment (String newComment) {...} 
	public String getComment() {...} 
	public void print() {...} 
}
```

Using inheritance we can:
	- define one superclass - ITEM
	- define subclasses for video and musicFile
	- Superclass defines common attributes
	- The subclasses inherit the superclass attributes
	- The subclasses add own attributes

So we write the following code of the Item class (which will be our superclass):
```Java
public class Item{ 
	private String Title; 
	private int playingTime; 
	private boolean gotIt; 
	private String comment; 

	public Item(Sring theTitle, int time){ 
		title = theTitle; 
		playingTime = time; 
		gotIt = false; comment = ""; 
	} 
	public void print(){ ... } ... }
```

So let's say we want to inherit from the item class to the music file class:
```Java
public class MusicFile extends Item{ 
	private String artist; 
	private int numberOfTracks; 
	public MusicFile(String theTitle, String theArtist, int tracks, int time){
		super(theTitle, time);
		artitst = theArtist; 
		numberOfTracks = tracks; 
		} 
		... 
	}

```


### Polymorphism

Object variables in Java are polymorphic â€“ they can hold objects of more than one type.
``` Java
Item item1 = new Item(...); 
Item item2 = new Video(...);
```
Polymorphism is where an object can take many different forms.
