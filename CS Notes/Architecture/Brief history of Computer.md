#### Abstraction

The lowest level is electrons and you go higher to make it easier to use for users.

Computers can be most generally thought as data processors.

#### Analogue and Digital computing
They use continuously variable analogues such as electric current or voltages to represent values. They are hard to design and build and not very programmable. 
==Analogue techniques are==: 
		- ==Presice== in that a voltage specifies a certain number exactly
		- ==Inaccurate== as reading off values always incurs errors. 

 ==Digital represenation is: ==
		- ==Impercise== in that certain values can't be represented exactly (like 1/3 in binary)
		- ==Accurate== in that readings are exact


#### Brief history of Computers
It all began with the **Antikythera Device** (100BC).

Then it was followed by the **Pascaline** by Balise Pascal. It could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition.

What we consider a computer from today's standard came much later. It was Charles Babbage's **Analytical engine** designed in 1837. The design could be described as Turing-Complete however Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding.

Ada Lovelace known to be the first ever programmer later wrote about the Analytical engine and the problems that can be solved. 

One of most notable individual in computer science is Alan Turing. He worked for the government code and cypher school. 

#### Base of generations of a Computer
1. Valves / Vacuum tubes 
	- Generated a lot of heat , Costly, Huge size, Consumed a lot of electricity. 
2. Transistors 
	- Smaller than vacuum tubes, no warm up time needed, consumed less energy, generated much less heat, faster and more reliable
3. Integrated Circuits (Chips) 
	- A lot of (100s) transistors in each chip. Made of semiconductors, normally silicon. 
4. LSI (Large Scale Integration) 
	- 1000s of transistors per chip. 
5. VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) 
	- Billions of transistors


A fully general computer must be Turing Complete. 

ENIAC (electronic digital computer) was the first computer that was programmable and general purpose. 

Processors have gotten smaller and smaller in scale have enabled for: 
- The rise of OS
- Networking, distributed computing
- Mobile and ubiquitous computing
