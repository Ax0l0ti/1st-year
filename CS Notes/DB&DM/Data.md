What is a database?
	A database is an organised collection of interrelated data that models some aspect of the real-world. 


### Flat file Databases
A flat file database is a type of database that stores data in a single table. Flat file databases are generally in plain-text form, where each line holds only one record. The fields in the record are separated using delimiters such as tabs and commas.

###### Advantages 
- Less resources (hardware and software) required. 
- Easy to understand and configure
- All records are stored in one place
###### Disadvantages
- It is more difficult to update
- It has greater chance of data redundancy and inconsistency
- Limited access

### Database management System (DBMS)
A DBMS allows the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.

It overcomes problems by:
	- Data integration
	- Data definition language
	- Data Abstraction

###### Advantages
- Efficient data access
- Data integriy and security
- Reduced application development time

###### Disadvantages
- Complexity of the software
- Size (resources to store and run)
- High Cost

### Relational Databases
Relational databases is a shared collection of logically related data and its description; ie collection of multiple tables that are related to each other. 

Relational Databases contain:
	- Entities
		- Person, Place, things, etc...
		- Attributes
			- Name, age, dob etc...
	- Relationships
		- An association between entities
		- Cardinality: one-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, many-to-one
